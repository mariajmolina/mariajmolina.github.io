I received a Bachelor of Science in Atmospheric Science and Meteorology with a Mathematics minor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville in May 2023. At UAH, I was a Student Specialist at the UAH Earth System Science Center where I collaborated with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Applied Sciences Disasters Program. I worked on creating a 20-year hail and wind damage swath event database that spanned across the Great Plains and Midwest for impact analysis and future applications. For my PhD, I am hoping to explore ENSO dynamics, teleconnections and impacts. There will be an emphasis on investigating how machine learning techniques can aid in answering questions surrounding ENSO. In my free time I enjoy drinking coffee, thrifting, and hiking!</p>
