My research focuses on Earth system dynamics and atmospheric predictability using machine learning and data-driven approaches. I work with Dr. Maria Molina and contribute to the WCRP Fresh Eyes on CMIP initiative and the AMS Committee on AI Applications to Environmental Science. As an ASP Graduate Visitor at US NSF NCAR (2024), I explored how global warming affects the mid-latitude large-scale circulation and surface extremes. My broader interests include extreme weather events, and climate variability and change. I use tools like tree-based models, deep learning, explainable AI, and causal discovery with Earth system models and reanalyses. I hold an engineering degree and a master’s in water resources from Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I enjoy sports, music, movies, and reading in my free time.</p>

I received a Bachelor of Science in Atmospheric Science and Meteorology with a Mathematics minor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville in May 2023. At UAH, I was a Student Specialist at the UAH Earth System Science Center where I collaborated with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Applied Sciences Disasters Program. I worked on creating a 20-year hail and wind damage swath event database that spanned across the Great Plains and Midwest for impact analysis and future applications. For my PhD, I am hoping to explore ENSO dynamics, teleconnections and impacts. There will be an emphasis on investigating how machine learning techniques can aid in answering questions surrounding ENSO. In my free time I enjoy drinking coffee, thrifting, and hiking!</p>

I received my MA in Climate & Society from Columbia University in 2021, and my BS in Computer Science, Math and Economics from The College of William & Mary in 2018. I am the primary maintainer of XCast, an open-source climate forecasting library. At UMD, I hope to apply AI/ML methods to explore interannual-to-interdecadal coupled earth system dynamics like ENSO, NAO, and PDO and their impacts on global hydroclimate predictability. In my spare time I hike, camp, read and drink coffee!</p>

        <p id="profilebio">I am starting the PhD track at the University of Maryland's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science in the fall of 2024. I received my Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the spring of 2024 with a double major in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Data Science with a certificate in Computer Science. My undergraduate thesis, with Greg Tripoli, was on connections between Indian Monsoonal outflow and intensifying African Easterly Waves. During my PhD, I hope to build machine learning tools that give us information about how weather extremes, like urban heat and hurricanes, are being altered in our changing climate. I also want to focus on how we can better communicate this information to communities who need it most. Some of my hobbies are board games, hiking, and playing Spikeball.</p>
